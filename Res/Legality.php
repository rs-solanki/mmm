<h2 class="heading">LEGALITY</h2>

 <p>MMM is a people community, which help each other for free, and 
absolutely consciously, they transfer money directly to each other, from
 one bank account to another, without any conditions, guarantees and 
promises. Just only because they want to do that. Because it is a good 
deal to help each other.</p>
<p>
It means the Mutual benefit fund as it is.</p>
<p>There is no formal organization, no legal person in MMM. And of 
course there is no central bank account, no other activity in any form. 
Neither close, nor open. There is nothing! There are only millions and 
millions of simple participants, simple private persons. And their bank 
accounts. And nothing more.</p>
<p>And of course there is no special registrations, permission and licenses in here.<br>
(Permissions and licenses for what and for what reason? For money 
transfer from one man to another? And whom this licenses and permissions
 should be given? :-))</p>
<p><b>Thus, MMM is absolutely legal and does not break any laws. Because
 there are only money transfers between private persons and nothing 
more.</b></p>
<p>
It is impossible to forbid MMM. The same way it is impossible to forbid 
people manage their own money the way they like. Thus they need to 
forbid the whole private property institution.</p>
<p>So everything is absolutely clear with the lawfulness. There are no 
violations and they won't be! Let's now talk about the other. About 
honesty. It is important to underline, that MMM doesn't cheat or abuse 
anyone. In other words it is not a cheat or fraud in any case! Everyone 
is <a href="#">informed about the possible and impossible risks fully and from the very beginning</a> (And everyone put a mark during the registration, confirming that he was informed about the warning.)</p>
<p>MMM itself is more honest (in 100 times!) than any other bank, or any
 financial institution with their licenses or permissions. Because they 
all lie to you, hold or keep back something and so on. And only MMM 
doesn't keep back you in silence, doesn't hide anything and tell 
everything honestly and openly. “Yes, You take a great risk!... Yes, no 
guarantees!... Yes, You may loose everything at any moment!...” - Did 
You hear the same before anywhere? Only in MMM.<br>
Honesty, honesty and again honesty! This is the main principle. Honesty,
 openness and trust. This are the three whales on which the System 
stands. Have ever seen before the situation, when absolutely 
unacquainted people transfer money to each other with no reason? Giving 
them like a gift actually? Millions and millions of people all over the 
world, every day? Delirium? Fiction? Utopia? No, it is MMM!</p>
<p>Participate! Welcome to the System! Long Live MMM!</p>

ATTENTION!<br>
Make money transfer only to those bank details which are specified on the order details page! If you are asked to make transfer to other bank details or wallet addresses ("card is blocked!", etc.) - do not get fooled. Make a report to support immediately! These are almost certainly fraudsters. On the other hand, sometimes a person has actually been hacked and they are trying to prevent loss. If they ask you to not send payment at all, this is a possibly what is happening. Send a message to recipient asking for further details or evidence. Exercise caution and wisdom.

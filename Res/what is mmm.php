<h2 class="heading">What Is MMM</h2>
    
 <div class="box">
<p style="font-style:italic;">Attention! First be sure to read the <a href="javaScrpit:(0);">WARNING!</a></p>
<p>MMM is not a bank, MMM does not collect your MONEY, MMM is not an online business, HYIP, investment or MLM program. MMM is a community where people help each other. MMM gives you a technical basic program, which helps millions of participants worldwide to find those who NEED help, and those who are ready to PROVIDE help for FREE. All transferred BITCOINS to another participants are your help given by your own good will to another one, absolutely gratis. If you are completely confident and certain in your actions and make your mind to participate, we kindly ask you to study carefully all warnings and instructions first. In cases of any matter regarding the topic our online consultants are ready to help and answer all your questions.</p>

<h2 class="heading">How Does It Work</h2>    
<img src="Images/how_is_work.jpg" width="60%"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MMM is a community of people providing each other financial help on 
the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence.</p>
<p>In MMM you don’t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In 
MMM there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one 
participant asks for help — another one helps.</p>
<p>The only thing that MMM demands from its participants is to be honest
 and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, 
you give financial help when you are able to do it.</p>
<p>In their transactions MMM participants operate with BITCOINS. It is 
the best possible way to organize smooth transfers between participants 
from different countries. Like BITCOIN causes revolution in financial 
relations, so MMM causes revolution in social relations between people. 
This combination of MMM and BITCOIN ideas of fair and free financial 
system makes possible for us to establish significant changes in modern 
world.</p>
<div style="padding:30px 0;font-weight:bold;">
<p>VERY IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>There is no сentral account, where all the System money flows to (and where it can be easily stolen from :-)). <em>All the money is only on the banking accounts of the participants themselves!</em> On a lot of thousand and million private accounts. <em>Participants transfer to each other directly, without intermediaries! (What are they for? :-))</em> In fact, MMM only regulates the process — nothing more.</p>
<p>So the System completely belongs to people. No kidding! It is a real mutual aid fund where ordinary people help each other.</p>
</div>    
<p>How does it work technically? You declare the willingness to give 
help (click in your Personal Office (hereinafter PO) "Provide Help"), 
after which your account will be rewarded with mavro (internal 
“currency”/scores of the System). Mavros will start growing from the 
moment of offering the contribution at the rate of 30% per month. 
(Calculation of reward occurs twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at
 00:00 GMT.) This sum in Mavro shows how much you can request for 
yourself.</p>    
<p>What this scale (20% — 100%) means? We make the participation in MMM 
Global more attractive and useful for everybody. We encourage our 
participant to be involved in development of MMM Global. Due to these 
reasons we’ve established MMM Extra. This model allows each participant 
to get 100% per month!</p>
<p>This new model itself is database of web-tasks available in your 
Personal Office and designed to promote MMM worldwide. We offer you an 
opportunity to perform these tasks in your PO and as a reward your Mavro
 will grow up to 100% per month. In your Personal Office you just need 
to buy special Mavro (Mavro-Extra). After buying these Mavro you have to
 go to the appropriate section in your PO, which is called MMM Extra. On
 the Extra’s main page you will find the list of current web-tasks. In 
order to make your Mavro grow up to 100% per month you have to perform 
these tasks on daily basis and your Mavro will grow on daily basis as 
well. Together with these tasks you will find all the necessary 
instructions, recommendations and screenshots. So it will be very easy 
for everybody to complete any task from the list. But if you do not 
perform any task from MMM Extra your Mavro will grow at the rate of 20% 
per month only, which is still not bad. The conclusion is: if you 
perform tasks from MMM Extra every day, your Mavro will grow at the rate
 of 100% per month; if you don’t perform any task, your Mavro will grow 
at the rate of 20% per month only.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an example now. Say, you have announced willingness to
 provide help in amount of $100. You will be credited in your PO with 
100 Mavros. And they will immediately start to grow every day! But the 
rate of growth directly depends on your activity. If you perform tasks 
every day, you get 100% per month. It means, that in a month your 
initial 100 Mavros will turn into 200 Mavros. Accordingly, you will be 
able to request assistance for $200 at the current BITCOIN exchange 
rate.</p>    
<p>However, it is not necessary to wait for a month. Help can be 
requested at any time. But only after confirmation of your Mavros. What 
does "after confirmation" mean? It means only after your BITCOIN 
transfer, when you really provide assistance to another participant. 
(But not just declare willingness. :-))&nbsp;Order for providing help 
comes to you in your Personal Office. If you do not complete it within 
36 hours, you will be removed from the System!</p>
<p>In cases of any questions regarding the topic your upline guiders are ready to help and answer all your questions.</p>
<p><em>Please note that the use of the words 30% a month cannot be 
considered as a yield or interest rate since the funds were given away, 
we are not earning anything anywhere (we are a mutual-aid fund), and 
nobody promises or guarantees to pay it! Read over <a href="http://www.mmmglobal.org/warning/">THE WARNING</a>.</em></p>    
<div class="box">    
<h2 class="heading">REFERRAL BONUS</h2>
<img src="Images/referral-bonus.png"/>    
<p>You get 10% from all deposits of the participant you invited. Inviting new members into the Community is your additional contribution to its development. But nobody force the members of the Community to invite new participants. But at the same time, understanding that MMM network can’t exist without development and participants’ encouragement in the form of referral bonuses motivate many people to take an active position.</p>    
</div>  
<h2 class="heading">GUIDER’S BONUS</h2>    
<p>Guiders of MMM Community can create their own multi-level structures and get a bonus from each donation of every participant in their structures. This is a multi-level bonus, thus a guider can have his own leader whose rank is higher. Guider’s bonus depends on his level in the Community:</p>    
<img src="Images/leaders-bonus.png"/>    
<p>For example, if you are Ronald’s guider, Ronald is Maricel’s guider and Maricel is Joseph’s, you will get 5% from Ronald’s donation, 3% from Maricel’s donation and 1% from Joseph’s. If someone will be under Joseph, you will get from him 0.5% and so on.</p>
<p>
Guider’s bonuses are credited in the same way as referral, but only from new money deposited and will be available to withdraw after confirmation of your help provided.</p>

<div class="t1">
MMM is a global mutual aid fund, financial social network. MMM isn’t a company, organization or a business project. MMM has its own website which connects participants who want to provide help directly with those who need help. The participants transfer money directly to each other, acting of their own free will. There aren’t any obligations and guarantees. If you have any other questions, please contact our guiders. They are always ready to help you.

<div class="t2">
The aim of MMM is to encourage and teach people to provide financial help to each other and change in this way the character of financial relations among people throughout the modern world. Unlike charity organizations that offer help to people who got into trouble, MMM promotes mutual help — everybody is helped and everybody helps. It paves the way to a more humane and fair society.
